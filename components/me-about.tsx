        I've loved creating things as long as I can remember. This is me on my

        pecking in programs. The "final boss" in this book was

        I got one working, neighbors would come over to play, and gape at the
        technilogical wonder.

        Walking downstairs from this photo, you'd find our lacquor-encrusted
        workshop, with an R/C plane üõ©Ô∏è mid-construction by my dad, and a model
        rocket üöÄ from me. I built upwards of 30 models back then, from plastic
        to R/C cars to rockets. Valuable early lessons in craftsmanship,
        extrapolation from incomplete datasets (the manual), fine motor control,
        and not stopping until it's done.

        That's thanks to the inspiration of my Scientist-Inventor grandfather,
        Percy Brooks, who had a dozen U.S. Patents to his name, and my dad
        checking out of the Ratrace at 40 to start his own computer business.

        Needless to say, I'm still a Level-90, Card-Carying gamer. As a
